Today was a very important day. After completing my second creation, I wanted to move on to my third. The second invention was very PCB design heavy, where I had to make sure every was routed efficiently. However, one aspect that I never got to go deeper into was portable objects, sound, or display hardware. Thus, for my 3rd creation, I wanted to make a game console. I was looking into the Gameboy color and trying to re-create it, as I was trying to go for a retro game console kinda look, and Pok√©mon, Tetris, and Super Mario were all things that I considered retro that were a part of the Gameboy color. However, I wanted to add my twist to it, but that's something that would be considered for later. Today, I just made sure to find all the parts I would need, and then I will start my schematic.

 A lot of the footprints for the switches I was planning to use were missing, so I spent most of today looking at SnapEDA to find footprints and to use GrabCAD to find 3D models of the objects so I can make some measurements relative to the microcontroller and the LED screen. As I was doing this, I realized I had to switch the microcontroller that I was using to a RASPBERRY PI ZERO 2 WH as it would be better for the situation of making a retro game console.

Today was a very important day. After completing my second creation, I wanted to move on to my third. The second invention was very PCB design-heavy, where I had to make sure every was routed efficiently. However, one aspect that I never got to go deeper into was portable objects, sound, or display hardware. Thus, for my 3rd creation, I wanted to make a game console. I was looking into the Gameboy color and trying to re-create it, as I was trying to go for a retro game console kinda look, and Pok√©mon, Tetris, and Super Mario were all things that I considered retro that was a part of the Gameboy color. However, I wanted to add my twist to it, but that's something that would be considered for later. Today, I made sure to find all the necessary parts, and then I will start creating my schematic.

 A lot of the footprints for the switches I was planning to use were missing, so I spent most of today looking at SnapEDA to find footprints and using GrabCAD to find 3D models of the objects so I could make some measurements relative to the microcontroller and the LED screen. As I was doing this, I realized I had to switch the microcontroller that I was using to a RASPBERRY PI ZERO 2 WH as it would be better for the situation of making a retro game console. 

I also took this opportunity to make a rough sketch of what my PCB would look like with the parts that I had.

Today was a bad day for me. Firstly, I wanted to look into the nuances of how the display would function and how the power supply and audio would work. I looked into these mainly because I wanted to make sure that I was performing all the new things as I wanted them to work. I found that I needed to ensure a constant power supply from the battery pack, so I required a buck converter. From this, I learned that this project was a little harder than I thought. This process of just learning and finding the footprints, and saving them was what took so long. Additionally, I realized I may not have enough digital pins in order to get this project done because the LED would be taking 26 pins. That was the biggest time waster; however, I found that not all pins were being used. So I found a table telling me which ones I can still use. Not much was done for the CAD or the PCB, so I included some pictures of my research and some websites I was using to prepare for the building.

All research today. I found 3D models for all my parts so that I could use them to make my case properly. I had to find exactly all the right parts that I was going to use in the process, so I made a folder with all the links to buying the parts and downloading the reference CAD models.

Today is where I wanted to start making my CAD model and making the design somewhat unique. Firstly, I didn't want to use audio, mainly because I looked for an LED screen that came with a headphone jack. I wanted to embrace a minimalist design look that is somewhat complex in appearance. Additionally, a buck converter would be unnecessary since I was delivering the right amount of voltage needed by the screen. Meaning I was done with my PCB and I started my PCB 3D model, so everything would be added so I can start making my case.

I was out with my family for the July 4th holiday and came back a bit late today. I wanted to start making the case. Mostly the bottom layer

Whole lot of changes today. Firstly, I wrote down a list of my pros and cons of my console. I hated all the cons, so I went down trying to fix all of them. Firslty was the battery. I wanted it to be rechargeable, so I switched to a lithium-ion battery and a boost converter. On top of that, these would be easier to wire onto the bottom of the Raspberry PI Zero 2. Next, I hated how long it was, so I changed the sizing of the PCB to make it better for myself and cheaper overall by making it under 100x100. I started to build the new case, and it was coming out a lot better. Finally, I hated how, when I was making the case rotary encoder would stick out. I thought that it would make things annoying, so I removed it. For my schematic I'll have to also document another way to show how I am soldering the wires to the bottom of the Micro Controller, but that is a plan for tomorrow along with making some sort of compartment for the battery and the boost converter.

# July 10th, 2025
I spent a whole lot of time today working on the CAD model today. I created a place for the battery and the boost converter, and the whole for it on the case. Additionally, I tried my best to minimize size wherever I can, so I spent a lot of time on that

I finished the whole CAD Model and began the easier part. A search for a community-built emulator for retro games. I found it super quick and it turned to be a software called Retro Pie. It would help configure most of my buttons as well so the firmware section got super easy for me. I also finished some schematic and had to create my own way to showcase how I would be soldering to the bottom of the Pi.

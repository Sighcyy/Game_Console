Today was a very important day. After completing my second creation, I wanted to move on to my third. The second invention was very PCB design-heavy, where I had to make sure every was routed efficiently. However, one aspect that I never got to go deeper into was portable objects, sound, or display hardware. Thus, for my 3rd creation, I wanted to make a game console. I was looking into the Gameboy color and trying to re-create it, as I was trying to go for a retro game console kinda look, and Pok√©mon, Tetris, and Super Mario were all things that I considered retro that was a part of the Gameboy color. However, I wanted to add my twist to it, but that's something that would be considered for later. Today, I just made sure to find all the parts I would need, and then I will start my schematic.

 A lot of the footprints for the switches I was planning to use were missing, so I spent most of today looking at SnapEDA to find footprints and using GrabCAD to find 3D models of the objects so I could make some measurements relative to the microcontroller and the LED screen. As I was doing this, I realized I had to switch the microcontroller that I was using to a RASPBERRY PI ZERO 2 WH as it would be better for the situation of making a retro game console. 

I also took this opportunity to make a rough sketch of what my PCB would look like with the parts that I had.

Today was a bad day for me. Firstly, I wanted to look into the nuances of how the display would function and how the power supply and audio. I looked into these mainly because I wanted to make sure that I was performing all the new things as I wanted them to work. I found that I would need to make sure that I was getting a constant supply of power from the battery pack, so I needed a buck converter. From this, I learned that this project was a little harder than I thought. Additionally, I wanted good sound quality, so I had to find an audio amp. This process of just learning and finding the footprints and saving them, was what took so long. Additionally, I realized I may not have enough digital pins in order to get this project done because the LED would be taking 26 pins. That was the biggest time waster; however, I found that not all pins were being used. So I found a table telling me which ones I can still use. Not much was done for the CAD or the PCB, so I included some pictures of my research and some websites I was using to prepare for the building.

All research today. I wanted to make sure I had to get the right measurements and found all my footprints for my buck converter and my audio amp. Additionally, I found a 3D model for all my parts so that I could use them to make my case properly. I had to find exactly all the right parts that I was going to use in the process, so I made a folder with all the links to buying the parts and downloading the reference CAD models.

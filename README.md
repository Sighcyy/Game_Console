# Project Goal
The goal of my third project was to explore the concept of portability, including LED screens and rechargeable batteries. I won't lie, I faced a lot of problems because of the items that I chose, which caused it to take a lot of time. However, this experience has made me better at creating portable devices. My future inventions would be easier to implemnt such things
